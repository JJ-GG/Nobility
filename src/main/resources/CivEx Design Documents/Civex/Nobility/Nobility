Nobility is another plugin that will open a ton of doors for us as developers. It allows us to present players with a clear, direct tech tree focused around settling down and working together as a group. Nobility will also tie nations to specific locations and region (e.g., “I live here because I control the region and have built all these improvements on the land“ as opposed to “I live here because my factories are here and it is expensive to move them”.) Finally, Nobility has the goal of improving warfare by offering new defensive/grief protections placed straight in the path of normal players, and reducing the amount of grind needed to be impactful on the game through vulnerability timers, siege improvements, and the Time Bank.
